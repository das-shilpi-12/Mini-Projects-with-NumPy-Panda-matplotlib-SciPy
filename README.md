1. NumPy


NumPy (Numerical Python) is the fundamental package for numerical computation in Python; it contains a powerful N-dimensional array object. It has around 18,000 comments on GitHub and an active community of 700 contributors. It’s a general-purpose array-processing package that provides high-performance multidimensional objects called arrays and tools for working with them. NumPy also addresses the slowness problem partly by providing these multidimensional arrays as well as providing functions and operators that operate efficiently on these arrays. 




Features:
Provides fast, precompiled functions for numerical routines
Array-oriented computing for better efficiency
Supports an object-oriented approach
Compact and faster computations with vectorization


Applications:
Extensively used in data analysis 
Creates powerful N-dimensional array
Forms the base of other libraries, such as SciPy and scikit-learn
Replacement of MATLAB when used with SciPy and matplotlib


2.Pandas:

Pandas (Python data analysis) is a must in the data science life cycle. It is the most popular and widely used Python library for data science, along with NumPy in matplotlib. With around 17,00 comments on GitHub and an active community of 1,200 contributors, it is heavily used for data analysis and cleaning. Pandas provides fast, flexible data structures, such as data frame CDs, which are designed to work with structured data very easily and intuitively. 



Features:


Eloquent syntax and rich functionalities that gives you the freedom to deal with missing data
Enables you to create your own function and run it across a series of data
High-level abstraction
Contains high-level data structures and manipulation tools


Applications: 


General data wrangling and data cleaning
ETL (extract, transform, load) jobs for data transformation and data storage, as it has excellent support for loading CSV files into its data frame format
Used in a variety of academic and commercial areas, including statistics, finance and neuroscience 
Time-series-specific functionality, such as date range generation, moving window, linear regression and date shifting.


3. Matplotlib:

Matplotlib has powerful yet beautiful visualizations. It’s a plotting library for Python with around 26,000 comments on GitHub and a very vibrant community of about 700 contributors. Because of the graphs and plots that it produces, it’s extensively used for data visualization. It also provides an object-oriented API, which can be used to embed those plots into applications. 


Features:
Usable as a MATLAB replacement, with the advantage of being free and open source 
Supports dozens of backends and output types, which means you can use it regardless of which operating system you’re using or which output format you wish to use
Pandas itself can be used as wrappers around MATLAB API to drive MATLAB like a cleaner
Low memory consumption and better runtime behavior


Applications:
Correlation analysis of variables
Visualize 95 percent confidence intervals of the models
Outlier detection using a scatter plot etc.
Visualize the distribution of data to gain instant insights


4.SciPy:

SciPy (Scientific Python) is another free and open-source Python library for data science that is extensively used for high-level computations. SciPy has around 19,000 comments on GitHub and an active community of about 600 contributors. It’s extensively used for scientific and technical computations, because it extends NumPy and provides many user-friendly and efficient routines for scientific calculations.

Features:
Collection of algorithms and functions built on the NumPy extension of Python
High-level commands for data manipulation and visualization
Multidimensional image processing with the SciPy ndimage submodule
Includes built-in functions for solving differential equations


Applications:
Multidimensional image operations
Solving differential equations and the Fourier transform
Optimization algorithms
Linear algebra
